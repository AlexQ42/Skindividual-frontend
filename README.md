## Description

"Skindividual" is a fictional online shop created for a university team project. The shop sells tickets for events and individual appointments dealing with skincare and wellness in Germany.
The website's frontend is written in JavaScript as a single-page-application using the React framework, Axios and Bootstrap. The design was developed and tested as a Figma prototype before implementing.
The backend of the website can be found in the [skindividual-backend repository](https://github.com/alexandrawaas/Skindividual-backend).

Each skincare event has its own info page. There, the desired amount of tickets can be added to the cart.

The website also offers an online test where customers can determine their own skintype. The skintype can then be saved in the customer account and used for finding the perfect skincare treatments.
